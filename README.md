# Parse Delimited API Data

 Demonstrates the concepts of accessing and parsing web APIs

## Discussion

This program is used to explain the concept of accessing and parsing data returned from a web API. This program uses the Scanner class to download data in a format that uses a combination of comma and colon delimited data. This is not how we would normally access web API data in our applications and only meant to help with understanding the process. This program uses a very basic back-end built on Glitch.
